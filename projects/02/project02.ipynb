    "The flights dataset for 2015 is not small (~600MB). While you could likely load the entire dataset into Pandas on your laptop, if you wanted to work with more than one year, this would quickly become difficult (the data is available for 1987-2018). Therefore, we will filter down the dataset into two smaller files without ever reading the larger dataset fully into memory. We are going to create two smaller datasets:\n",

    "1. All flights arriving or departing from San Diego International Airport in 2015.\n",
    "    - You can find a list of all the airport codes in the United States [here](https://www.leonardsguide.com/us-airport-codes.shtml).\n",
    "2. All flights flown by either JetBlue or Southwest Airline in 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you are going to use the `chunksize=N` keyword in Pandas `read_csv` to read the flights dataset in blocks of `N` lines. When you use this keyword argument, `pd.read_csv(fp, chunksize=N)` becomes a *iterator* that iterates through dataframes of length N until you have reached the end of the dataset. A typical pattern looks like:\n",

    "2. Filtering out rows of each chunk\n",
    "3. Incrementally add to a filtered csv file (since the data is perhaps too big to keep in memory). Keep in mind, if you want to keep writing to the same file, the mode='a' keyword in the `.to_csv` method can be helpful when calling it in the loop (a stands for 'append')\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Write two functions that create the datasets below, using the 'chunking' pattern described above. Your functions should use `chunksize` of 10000.\n",

    "Now we would like to understand how data is missing in the flights data. First, compute the proportion of each column of `flights` which are non-null. Do not turn this in, but it will be useful information in doing the next few problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that a column is *missing by design* if you can determine when the entry of a column is missing based solely on other data in the same row. That is\n",
    "* there is *no randomness* in determining when an entry is missing.\n",
    "* you can describe when the column is missing a value with a logical (not random) condition.\n",
    "* you can express which rows will have missing values in terms of logical statements about the *other* columns in the same row.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this question, verify the following columns are *missing by design*:\n",
    "* The column `ARRIVAL_DELAY` is *missing by design*. Create a function `predict_null_arrival_delay` that doesn't depend on the values of `ARRIVAL_DELAY`, that:\n",
    "    - Takes in a row of the flights data (that is, a Series)\n",
    "    - Returns `True` if and only if the `ARRIVAL_DELAY` is null; otherwise it returns `False`.\n",
    "    - Since the function doesn't depend on `ARRIVAL_DELAY`, it should work on a row even if the `ARRIVAL_DELAY` index is dropped.\n",
    "    - You can check your function by using `flights.drop('ARRIVAL_DELAY', axis=1).apply(predict_null, axis=1)` and compare it to the `ARRIVAL_DELAY` column!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The column `AIRLINE_DELAY` is *missing by design*. As above, create a function `predict_null_airline_delay` that doesn't depend on the values of `AIRLINE_DELAY`, that:\n",
    "    - Takes in a row of the flights data (that is, a Series)\n",

    "    - *Remark*: to help your work, create helper functions whose output you can plot, to assess the correctness of your p-value!\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Use your function above to determine the columns `col` for which \"`DEPARTURE_DELAY` is MAR dependent on `col`\" using a significance level of 0.01. Only consider the categorical columns `YEAR`,`DAY_OF_WEEK`, `AIRLINE`,`DIVERTED`, `CANCELLATION_REASON`. Return your answer in a (hard-coded) list returned by a function called `dependent_cols`.\n",
    "\n",

    "    - The values should contain the most-likely missingness type of each column. \n",
    "    - The values of this Series should be `MD, MCAR, MAR, MNAR, NaN` (use `NaN` if there are no missing values). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint:* for missingness permutation tests, try using TVD as a test statistic! You are taking the TVD between the distributions of `True` and `False` for those non-numerical columns; `True` being the proportions of null values, `False` being the proportions of non-null values.
