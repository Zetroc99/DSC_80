    "# Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "In the power outages dataset, I will be attempting a classification problem to determine the cause of a major power outage.\n",
    "The target variable in this case is very simply the \"CAUSE.CATEGORY\" variable in the dataset, as it is able to distinguish between seven general forms of ways to cause a major power outage. And the evaluation metric that I will be looking at will be accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Model\n",
    "The baseline model had 3 features:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - 2 Nominal ('CLIMATE.REGION', 'HURRICANE.NAMES')\n",
    "    - 1 Quantitative ('POPULATION')\n",
    "and the target variable ('CAUSE.CATEGORY'). The baseline model ran on the KNeighbors Classifier had an accuracy performance of about 0.69 in the training set and about 0.60 in the testing set. I think the numbers are better than I expected given the simlicity of the varibles used, and the lack of quanititative and oridinal data. But I do think that there is plent of room for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Model\n",
    "The final model had one more feature added and two new features engineered:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - 1 Quantitative added('ANOMALY.LEVEL')\n",
    "    - 'HURRICANE.NAMES' was one hot encoded on whether there was or wasn't a hurricane\n",
    "    - 'POPULATION' was normalized\n",
    "The final model ran on a Decision Tree Classifier with the best 'max_depth' parameter being the most optimal at 15. The model was able to perform better in both training and in testing. The training accuracy was about 0.89 and the testing was about 0.64. Both improvements from the basline model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fairness Evaluation\n",
    "I performed a fairness evaluation on a subset of the data consisting of whether or not an outage was caused by a hurricane. So the variable 'HURRICANE.NAMES' became 'is_hurricane' and then I explored whether the model was fairer towards outages caused by hurricanes or not. I used accuracy as a parity measure because I wanted to determine whether my model has higher a higher success of correctly predicting the label for an outage caused by a hurricane. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the permutation test with a significance level of 0.05 we had the following null and alternative hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - H0: My model is fair, the accuracy for my hurricane and no hurricane are about the same.\n",
    "    - H1: My model is unfair; the accuracy for hurricane is higher than with no hurricane.\n",
    "From the permuation test as shown below in the coding section, we must reject the null hypothesis and deternmine that there is no accuracy parity"
